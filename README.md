# massduino_boards

This is an unofficial Arduino board support package for MassDuino boards by [INHAOS](http://www.inhaos.com/),
based on official package V46r2 available [here](http://www.inhaos.com/download.php).

Besides packaging, this BSP includes a few trivial changes to add C++11 support, which is needed to compile
the latest Arduino libraries.
